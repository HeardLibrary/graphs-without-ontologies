#Graphs without Ontologies
##Using Neo4j to Explore Nascent Research Networks

A presentation by Clifford Anderson, Suellen Stringer-Hye and Ed Warga to the [2015 VIVO Conference](http://vivoconference.org/) in Cambridge, MA.

###Introduction

This repository contains the code and data we used for our presentation at the 2015 VIVO Conference. This readme document describes how to use the code to extract a dataset from an OAI-PMH compliant metadat repository, ingest the data into Neo4j, and analyze patterns using the Cypher query language.

###Abstract
Graphs are the fundamental concept behind both linked data and the semantic web. Research networks are, like all social networks, essentially graph structures. We argue that exploring research networks simply as graphs–without the complexities of the semantic web stack–provides an easy way to start visualizing and analyzing them.

Neo4j is an open source graph database that makes it straightforward to represent data as vertices and edges. Neo4j provides a simple, declarative query language called Cypher, allowing users to readily explore and ask questions of large graph datasets. 

Our talk presents graph theory as distinct from both linked data and the semantic web. We provide a quick introduction to Neo4j and the Cypher query language. Using those tools, we then visualize and analyze the data in a prominent institutional repository as a scholarly network. We show how to use graph databases as a kind of scratch pad to assist with representing emergent research networks.
